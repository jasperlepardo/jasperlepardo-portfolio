    <p class="lead mb-8">Peddlr is a mobile point-of-sale (POS) app designed to help micro and small business owners digitize their store operations. With many users being first-time digital adopters, the app must prioritize usability, clarity, and user confidence. As part of a design challenge for a job application, I took on the task of redesigning the Peddlr homepage to make it more intuitive and accessible. The focus was on improving layout clarity, establishing a stronger visual hierarchy, and creating a more task-oriented navigation experience.</p>
    <p class="lead">The redesign was completed within a 3-day sprint. My approach began with auditing the existing user interface to uncover accessibility and usability issues. I identified key pain points, including cluttered navigation and hard-to-read icons, which hindered the user experience. From there, I prioritized improving layout clarity and visually grouping related functions to enhance comprehension. The final step involved prototyping and refining the new homepage design in Figma, ensuring it was ready for developer handoff.</p>
