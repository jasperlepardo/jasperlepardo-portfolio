title: "Enhancing KDS Accessibility"
description: "Transformed a kitchen display system for color-blind staff by introducing high-contrast palettes, pattern overlays, and clear labels—enabling faster, more reliable order tracking."

heading: Designing an Inclusive Kitchen Display System for CloudEats
summary: "Over a one-week sprint, I redesigned CloudEats' Kitchen Display System (KDS) to better support color-blind users. Inspired by Trello’s color-blind friendly labels, I introduced a dual-coded visual system using both color and pattern. The result: faster order recognition, zero confusion, and a more inclusive kitchen experience."
