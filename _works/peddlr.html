    <h3 class="font-bold text-zinc-200 mb-4 uppercase">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="text-xl text-zinc-300 font-light mb-4 leading-tight">Peddlr is a mobile point-of-sale (POS) app that helps micro and small business owners digitize their store operations. Many of its users are first-time digital adopters, which makes usability, clarity, and confidence essential to their experience.</p>
    <p class="text-xl text-zinc-300 font-light leading-tight">As part of a design challenge for a job application, I redesigned the homepage to be more intuitive and accessible—focusing on layout clarity, visual hierarchy, and task-oriented navigation.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-40 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <h3 class="font-bold text-zinc-200 mb-4 uppercase">Approach</h3>
    <p class="text-xl text-zinc-300 font-light leading-tight">I was tasked with redesigning the Peddlr homepage over a 3-day sprint. My design process included:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc text-zinc-300 pl-8 text-xl font-light">
        <li>Auditing the current UI for accessibility and usability issues</li>
        <li>Identifying pain points, such as cluttered navigation and unreadable icons</li>
        <li>Prioritizing layout clarity and visual grouping of functions</li>
        <li>Prototyping and refining the design in Figma for developer handoff</li>
    </ul>
